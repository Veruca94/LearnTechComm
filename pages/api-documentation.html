                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>API (Application Programming Interface) documentation is a highly specialized and increasingly crucial area of technical writing that focuses on creating comprehensive guides for developers who need to integrate with, implement, or use software APIs. API technical writers create documentation that explains how an API functions, including detailed descriptions of endpoints, parameters, request/response formats, authentication methods, error handling, and integration examples.</p>

                    <p>The primary audience for API documentation consists of software developers, system architects, and engineers who need precise, accurate information to successfully implement API integrations. Unlike user-facing documentation, API documentation assumes a technical audience and requires the writer to understand programming concepts, software architecture, and development workflows. According to industry data, API technical writers in the USA earn between $89,563 and $128,400, with an average salary of $111,760, reflecting the specialized nature of this role.</p>

                    <p>API technical writers often work closely with software engineers, product managers, and developers to understand functionality, test endpoints, and ensure documentation accuracy. They must stay current with API technologies, documentation standards like OpenAPI/Swagger, and developer experience best practices. This field is particularly important in technology companies, SaaS platforms, and any organization that provides programmatic access to their services.</p>

                        <p><strong>Industry Insight:</strong> Well-crafted API documentation can be a significant competitive advantage, reducing integration time and support costs while improving developer satisfaction and adoption. Poor API documentation, conversely, is often cited as a major pain point in developer surveys.</p>
