                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Policy and procedure documentation is essential to organizational success, providing the foundation for consistent operations, regulatory compliance, and quality assurance. Technical writers in this specialization create comprehensive documents that define how organizations operate, establish guidelines for decision-making, and ensure uniformity across departments and teams.</p>

                    <p>Policies define organizational rules, principles, and guidelines that govern behavior and decisions, while procedures provide step-by-step instructions for implementing those policies and completing specific tasks. Together, they create a framework that helps organizations achieve efficiency, maintain quality standards, reduce miscommunication, and comply with industry regulations and legal requirements.</p>

                    <p>This field is critical in highly regulated industries such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and government, where clear documentation of policies and procedures is often mandatory. Writers in this area must balance clarity with precision, ensuring documents are both accessible to employees and comprehensive enough to satisfy regulatory requirements.</p>
